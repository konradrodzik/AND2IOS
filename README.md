Convert Android views to iOS views

Description:
Console tool for converting Android views (xml) to iOS classes (.h + .m)

Usage:
By pointing AND2IOS to the Android resource folder, it will create new iOS files (.h .m), representing android views as iOS native views.
It's also extracting graphical resources from Android project and put them into output directory which you can freely add to your iOS project.

It will automatically create action methods for buttons etc...

After conversion you only need to add these classes to your project + graphical resource files and recompile your project.
